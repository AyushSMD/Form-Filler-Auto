### Example JSON Format

```json
{
  "Full Name": "John Doe",
  "Email Address": "john@example.com",
  "Gender": "Male",
  "Birth Date": "01/01/1990",
  "Hobbies": ["Reading", "Traveling"]
}
```

### JSON formatting Guide ###

- The program is **capable of detecting the type of input feild**, just write the label as the key and the value you want to input as key value pairs in the JSON file.
- **Strings**, **Numbers** and **Email** are to be written **directly**.
- For **Radio buttons** just mention the option you want to be selected.
- For **Google Dates** popups mention the date in the `DD/MM/YYYY` format.
    ````json
    "Birth Date": "01/01/1990",
    ````
- In case of a **Dropdown** having acronyms or alternate version of the desired selection you may mention both and the program will select the one that matches. Just write normal key value pairs in normal cases

    ````json
    "company" :["NASA","National Aeronautics and Space Administration"]
    ````
- For **Checkboxes** mention the options that you want to select.
    ````json
    "Hobbies": ["Reading", "Traveling"]
    ````
